- make task-type configurable

- catch focus in BFDestinationCtrl (bug: next ctrl without focus)

- make date and time format customizable
- open website in a thread (this don't freez the app; thread-sample) 
- remember last concret backup files and delete them automaticly (by count, by timespan, by size)
- exclude-control for directory-tasks (with filters: look on "abakt")
- animate progress
- handle process-priority (do not freeze the hole system)
- check for enough free space on destination drive
- backup to password-protected-samba
- backup to ftp
- using commandline without gui (controlable by things like cronjob)

- help: maybe use highlited textfields instead of tooltips
- help: describe unsage based on usecases
- help: context-sensitiv (tooltips, optional (context sensitiv!) tip-ctrl in the mainframe)
- full customizable keybord-shortcuts based on the menus
