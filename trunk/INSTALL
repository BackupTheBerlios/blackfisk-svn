There is no need for a install routine. Just unpack all files to a directory
and start the binary (blackfisk.exe on windows).
On first start Blackfisk will create a configuration file "blackfisk.cfg" and
a log file "bf.log".
That is all!

Please feel free to contact me if you need more informations!
