- BUG: modify destination on volumes cause in crash!
-    : "add as destination directory" (dir-ctrl) crashes
-    : PopupMenu() used with wxMenu on stack or heap? (causes in crash with MSVC but not with MinGw)

- register BFP-Files with wxMimeTypesManager::AddFallback
- maybe kill Progress::bDeadCountMode_ & all affected members?

- fix wxSerialize compiler warnings

- tooltip with task-infos on mouse-over on a backup-task
- tooltips on BFHyperlinkCtrl with URL

- remove verify-flag on sync-tasks?

- auto-save-project option

- Drag&Drop source to an empty project open a task-dialog with an empty destination
  -> "select destination dialog" should open automaticly in that case

- BIG TEST: Check what kind of messages arrive while a backup
  in the log-files (app, project, task), in the while-backup-log-window, in the
  backup-progress-with-message-control and anywhere
  test ALL different verbose levels!

0.0.1
~~~~~
- Backup-LOG: Zusammenfassung (Zählung) der copy, delete, create aktionen (hauptsächlich bei sync)
- improve BFBackupInfoCtrl with easier readable messages (icons, colors)
  maybe with wxListBox, wxListCtrl or wxGrid
- log files as parseable (for icons) text-files and/or standard conform html-files or pdf
- BUG: wxGenericDirCtrl change the working dir (look at wxDD_CHANGE_DIR)

0.0.2
~~~~~
- WebUpdater
- changing the destination of a sync-task should move the exsiting destination, too (ask the user)
- don't make a complete rebuild of BFBackupCtrl if just a new task is added
- using commandline without gui (controlable by things like cronjob)
- new advanced-option: ask-on-message (true/false) while autorun (non-gui)
- remember last concret backup files and delete them automaticly (by count, by timespan, by size)
- auto-update: run tasks different times (e.g. TaskA each day, TaskB just each week)
- BUG: freez on not enough space
- check for enough free space on destination drive
- make date and time format customizable

0.0.3
~~~~~
- (???) correct sorting of dirs and tasks (first sub-dirs and then tasks) when DnD a task to a new destination
- (maybe) improved exclude-control for directory-tasks (wxVirtualDirTreeCtrl from JBode; with filters: look on "abakt")
- help: tutorials/howtos with wink
- full customizable keybord-shortcuts based on the menus
- size informations about backuped files, etc

0.0.4 and later
~~~~~
- more translations
- backup to password-protected-samba
- backup to ftp
- supported operating systems: Win32, MAC OS X, linux/unix (debian), ReactOS, Zeta

+ look on "abakt" for more ideas
