~~~~~
- backup-context-menu in backupDirCtrl, too! (to backup a backup)
- BUG: wxGenericDirCtrl change the working dir
- help: context-sensitiv (tooltips, optional (context sensitiv!) tip-ctrl in the mainframe)
- a check routine before a backup: does all sources and destinations exsits? free space?
- verify: compare modification time

0.0.2
~~~~~
- exclude-control for directory-tasks (wxVirtualDirTreeCtrl from JBode; with filters: look on "abakt")
- changing the destination of a sync-task should move the exsiting destination, too (ask the user)
- don't make a complete rebuild of BFBackupCtrl if just a new task is added
- settings: show hiddenfiles in dirCtrl (check box in top of the dir ctrl)
- swap backupctrl and dirctrl
- remember window position and size incl splitwindow
- WebUpdater
- correct sorting of dirs and tasks (first sub-dirs and then tasks) when DnD a task to a new destination
- BUG: catch focus in BFDestinationCtrl (bug: next ctrl without focus)
- redesign the layers:
  separate code for BFRootTask and BFRootTaskData,
  maybe: remove GetStopCurrentTask() and GetStopProject() from BFRootTask to BFApp?,
  etc
- display "show-log" progress after a backup
- calculate time while backup-process
- sync directories: more detailed settings (delete?)
- using commandline without gui (controlable by things like cronjob)
- new advanced-option: ask-on-message (true/false) while autorun (non-gui)
- remember last concret backup files and delete them automaticly (by count, by timespan, by size)
- auto-update: run tasks different times (e.g. TaskA each day, TaskB just each week)
